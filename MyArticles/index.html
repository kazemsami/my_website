But because it is in our nature to be greedy about secrets that benefit us in many ways, and we would rather keep them to ourselves.
    Many people might argue about this and it might cause controversies. But that won't discourage me from sharing it with everyone.

    You could be wondering, why is fear mentioned. You might have said "I already know what fear is". But let me tell you why I included it on one of the hidden things. Most importantly why am I telling you this first.
    <br/><br/>
    Did you know that fear could actually interfere with your daily work, and hinder the way you think? If you know how to properly control fear, you will have nothing to worry about and you would finally break-free.
    <br/>
    Have you noticed often, when talking with friends or anyone else, they would always try and show dominance or act like they are in control? What they are really trying to do is daze you or more accurately, make you fear them. Basically trying to hypnotize you with fear. Once they take control over you, they start making you do things. Things that you wouldn't usually do, but you would still do them, not because you want to, but because you are controlled by fear.
    </br><br/>
    You might be asking, so what am I supposed to do in this circumstance? Most people would tell you to just ignore these kind of people, but sometimes that isn't so easy, especially when they already have you in their pockets. So you have to ask yourself, why are you afraid of them? Would they actually hurt you? If they would, would you fight back? If they wouldn't, you could just tell them what you truly feel about them and that you are not comfortable with them bossing you around. If they would actually hurt you, your best choice, would be to just stay calm and most importantly show no signs of fear. Humans can easily smell someones fear, not as well as dogs, but we still can. So if you try and be fearless for a moment and give them your best calm and serious (I would kill you, if you mess with me) look. They would flee away like ants.
